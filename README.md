# ANALYZING-CRIME-IN-LOS-ANGELES-USING-PYTHON
Supporting Safer Communities in Los Angeles Through Data Analysis 🕵️‍♂️📊
Los Angeles — the City of Angels, Tinseltown, and the Entertainment Capital of the World — is known for its sunny weather, iconic palm trees, and vibrant culture. But like any major city, it faces challenges with crime. 

In this project, I analyzed LAPD crime data to identify patterns in criminal activity across neighborhoods, crime types, and time periods.

The insights aim to help law enforcement allocate resources more effectively, tackle high-risk areas, and ultimately make the city safer for its residents.

This work combines data exploration, visualization, and actionable insights to turn raw data into meaningful strategies for public safety.

This project explores crime patterns in Los Angeles using a dataset from Los Angeles Open Data. By analyzing trends across neighborhoods, crime types, and time periods, the goal is to provide actionable insights that help the LAPD allocate resources effectively and enhance public safety.
